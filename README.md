# Readme-Generator-Node
Module 11 Challenge: Professional README Generator

  ![GitHub License](http://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)

  ## Description

  This Readme-Generator-Node was created for bootcamp students who were taking the eleventh week's challenge. In this challenge, my task was to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input.

The readme generator application must meet the following critical requirements:

* Create a command-line application that accepts user input.
  * When a user is prompted for information about the application repository then a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with:
    * The title of my project 
    * Sections entitled:
      * Description 
      * Table of Contents 
      * Installation 
      * Usage 
      * License 
      * Contributing 
      * Tests 
      * Questions
  * When a user enters the project title then it is displayed as the title of the README
  * When a user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions then this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
  * When a user chooses a license for their application from a list of options then a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled **License** that explains which license the application is covered under
  * When a user enters their GitHub username then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to their GitHub profile
  * When a user enters their email address then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach them with additional questions
  * When a user clicks on the links in the **Table of Contents** then they are taken to the corresponding section of the README

  ```
  The application will generate a "sample-README.md" file for you to test. 
  If you want to generate a default "README.md" for your project, 
  just change the file name "sample-README.md" in the "index. js" 
  file to "README.md".
  ```
  To check whether the application meets critical requirements, open  [sample-README.md](https://github.com/qingh2o/Readme-Generator-Node/blob/main/sample-README.md) file.
